# Skyblock-Auction-Flipper
Stop wasting hours refreshing the Auction House. Let the code do the work.

This mod runs in the background while you play. 
It constantly scans the Hypixel Auction House API, compares prices against the lowest market value (LBIN), and instantly alerts you when someone lists an item for a cheap price.

🚀 Key Features

⚡ Zero Lag: Runs on a dedicated asynchronous thread. It will never drop your FPS.🧠 Smart AI Logic: Doesn't just look for "cheap" items. It calculates ROI (Return on Investment) and Net Profit to ensure you only see flips worth buying.

🔊 Audio Alerts: Plays a distinct "Ding" sound when a flip is found. You can watch YouTube or semi-AFK in your island while waiting for money.🖱️ One-Click Sniping: The chat alert includes a clickable [VIEW] button that instantly runs the /viewauction command for you.🛡️ Is this Safe?Yes. This mod is 100% Client-Side and TOS Compliant.✅ No Macros: It does NOT auto-buy items. You must manually click the buy button in the game.

✅ No Packets: It uses the public Hypixel Web API, just like a website. It does not send weird packets to the server.

⚙️ How to Use
